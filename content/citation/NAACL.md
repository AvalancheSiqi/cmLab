### Overall stats:

* 17 years of publication 1991--2015, 2159 papers total
* 19563 references total, average 9.06 per paper
	* 856 reference venues, 79.0% in top 25 
* 32395 citations total, average 15.0 per paper
	* 1122 citations venues, 75.0% in top 25 
 



The half-wheel on the left is a snapshot of the top venues that cites and cited by this venue (details in Figure 4 below). The plots on the rest of this page roughly breaks down into four types. 

* Figure 1 - Figure 3 contains basic stats of papers, references and citations over its lifetime. 
* Figure 4 and 5 summarizes the incoming and outgoing citations over all years, sorted by the ratio of incoming over outgoing citations (left to right).
* Figure 5 and 6 breaks down the incoming and outgoing citations by year of the conference paper. 
* Figure 7 and 8 breaks down the outgoing references by the year they were cited in this conference. For most conferences we can see a 'google scholar' effect that more older papers gets cited in recent years, likely due to the ease of finding them. 

**Note**: This page visualizes reference and citation patterns of one conference, generated from templates. For a written overview of the visualization series, and background about problem, motivation and methods please see the [overview page](/post/citation_vis).

Fig 4. Summary of incoming vs outgoing citations to the top-K venues. Node colors: ratio of citations (outgoing ideas, red) vs references (incoming ideas, blue). Node sizes: amount of total citation+references in either direction. Thickness of blue edges are scaled by the number of references going to a given venue; thickness of red edges are scaled by the number of citations coming from a given venue. Nodes are sorted left-to-right by the ratio of incoming vs outgoing citations to this conference.

Fig 5. Incoming vs outgoing citations to the top-K venues (this bar graph presents information from the half-circle differently). (blue) The number of references going to a given conference or journal; (red) The number of citations coming from a given conference or journal. The x-axis is sorted by the ratio of incoming vs outgoing citations to the conference, highest on the right.
