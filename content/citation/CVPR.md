Fig 4. Summary of incoming vs outgoing citations to the top-K venues. Node colors: ratio of citations (outgoing ideas, red) vs references (incoming ideas, blue). Node sizes: amount of total citation+references in either direction. Thickness of blue edges are scaled by the number of references going to a given venue; thickness of red edges are scaled by the number of citations coming from a given venue. Nodes are sorted left-to-right by the ratio of incoming vs outgoing citations to this conference.
