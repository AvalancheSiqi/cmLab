### Inward Bound Champion - Siqi Wu

[Inward Bound (IB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inward_Bound) is an endurance and orienteering running competition held between the residential halls and colleges of the Australian National University with participation from the Australian Defence Force Academy. With 53 annual races having been held to date at ANU, it is a unique and the most prestigious event combining aspects of both orienteering and rogaining while challenging personal endurance.

There are generally seven divisions in the competition, which are dropped off, blindfoled, at an unkonwn location in the bush. The Division 1, which Siqi participated in, is to be dropped off up to 70 km (as the longest crow-fly distance) from the end point. He is the only veteran, with 3 other yound lads, and they were dropped near Clear Ranges, deep south of Canberra this year. Their bold plan of taking a longer but more runnable route separated them from all other teams. However, this also incurred doubts since people couldn’t tell wether they chose this route on propose or got lost completely. Luckily, they all merged to the same path with 10km to go and overtook the leaders with mere 4km from end point. After about 13 hours, 94km of running, they claimed the winner of Inward Bound 2017. Siqi believes winning IB is surely a remarkable memory for his ANU journey and it’s also one of the highest achievement.

For those who are interested in orienteering, Siqi pointed out that there are many standard orienteering events which focus on shorter distance. Reading geographical features, navigating via compass and enduring long distance trekking are three basic components in this sports. He suggests beginners should ideally practice a lot in those events before participating in IB, otherwise it’s very likely to get lost at middle night and find yourself surrounded by kangaroos and wombats!

### GovHack Awardee - Alex Mathews

Alex Mathews took part in the GovHack 2017 Hackathon. [GovHack](https://govhack.org/about-us/) is an annual volunteer run international competition and community development event, which brings together technology creatives and innovators from the private, public and government sectors with government data to explore and discover new ways to help create a better society. In a team of 5, they completed a project named "[Scenic Cycle](https://2017.hackerspace.govhack.org/project/scenic-cycle)" which provides Canberrans with a platform to plan leisurely bike routes around the city. The aim is to foster interest in riding beyond commuting and encourage the community to discover more about their local area. The project is built on top of the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/) where Logstash handles location data ingest, processing and indexing, and storage and querying is performed by Elastic Search. The project eventually brought them the "Best Use of the Elastic Stack".

### Bowling night in Belconnen

On 12 October, we had a bowling night at AMF Bowling Belconnen. To fuel our energy for bowling, we first had delicious burgers and drinks together at The London Burgers and Beers. With foods and beers, we were hoping for the winning of bowling mathces.

As we took over three lanes, we started our game by competing individually at each lane. Many of us had never played bowling before, but we picked up and enjoyed the game pretty soon. After the fierce competition, Andrei won the first game, followed by Dawei who won the second one. For the last game, we competed as groups and the fun of the bowling remained throughout the whole night!

### Kayaking on Lake Burley Griffin

On 8 December, we drove to Yarralumla Bay on the beautiful Lake Burley Griffin for kayaking. People were already eager to try while preparation. The warm sunshine and moderate temperatures led everyone to enjoy the view and paddling on the lake, regardless the fact that most of us were new to kayak. As we paddled, we floated around the lake. Some then started race competitions, while others were just slowly paddling along the wind. Although everyone was getting tired, two hours of kayaking still slipped away very soon and people landed with joy.

As the end of today's activity, we drove to city and had a dinner at Asian Noodles House. With noodles, rice and snack, we reviewed and concludedour achievements in 2017, and hoped for another year of great work in 2018!
