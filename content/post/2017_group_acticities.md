### Bowling night in Belconnen

On 12 October, we had a bowling night at AMF Bowling Belconnen. To fuel our energy for bowling, we first had delicious burgers and drinks together at The London Burgers and Beers. With foods and beers, we were hoping for the winning of bowling mathces. <br />

As we took over three lanes, we started our game by competing individually at each lane. Many of us had never played bowling before, but we picked up and enjoyed the game pretty soon. After the fierce competition, Andrei won the first game, followed by ?? who won the second one. For the last game, we competed as groups and the fun of the bowling remained throughout the whole night!

### Lake Burley Griffin Kayak

On 8 December, we drove to Yarralumla Bay on the beautiful Lake Burley Griffin for kayaking. People were already eager to try while preparation. The warm sunshine and moderate temperatures led everyone to enjoy the view and paddling on the lake, regardless the fact that most of us were new to kayak. As we paddled, we floated around the lake. Some then started race competitions, while others were just slowly paddling along the wind. Although everyone was getting tired, two hours of kayaking still slipped away very soon and people landed with joy.
