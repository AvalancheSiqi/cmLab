On April 2, group members went to Mt. Kosciuszko for climbing. It is always fun to do some research in the lab. Once you live in Australia, however, you are under an obligation to enjoy beautiful  nature, which is also one of the best ways to unwind stresses from hard work. Mt. Kosciuszko is located in the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves, in New South Wales. It took approx. 3 hours from Canberra. On the way to the mountain, we passed a peaceful small town, Cooma, and a beautiful lake, Jindabyne, also enjoyed scenic view along the road.

Mt. Kosciuszko is the highest mountain in Australia, of which height is 2,228 metres (7,310 ft) above sea level. You may wonder how the group of researchers climbed such a really high mountain. Don't worry! 
The peak can be approached from [Thredbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thredbo,_New_South_Wales), which is a village and ski resort located above 1,300m. Furthermore, this track is supported by a chairlift all-year round. But don't underestimate; it is still 6.5 kilometres from the top of the chairlift to the peak, taking 3 hours for a round trip. We had a windy and cold weather but it didn't bother us. All members could safely reach the top. Beautiful scenery in Autumn & would love to visit in snow season!
