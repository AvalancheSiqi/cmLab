## Hiking in Wombeyan Caves

Before Data61 Machine Learning retreat, group members took a tour in [Wombeyan Caves](http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/parks/Wombeyan-Karst-Conservation-Reserve) and hiked Australian bush. Wombeyan Caves are formed between 400 and 430 million years ago. Those magnificent marbles are delicate to light therefore only a handful of them are opened for visiting. And we had to walk down steep stairs, go through wet rocky trail under a mere light, believe me it's challenging! After that we hiked Mares Forest Creek walking track, which lead us to the riverside.

## Cherry-picking in Young<br />

We took the advantage of warm December and headed to [Young](http://www.visithilltopsregion.com.au/Visit-Young/Whats-On/National-Cherry-Festival), as known as "cherry capital of Australia" for delicious cherries. Young holds National Cherry Festival on the first weekend in December and this year is 67th! The orchard is quite popular on weekends in cherry-picking season. We had to squeeze in the transfer truck, stood in the truck freight was an "unique" experiment but the cherries made it worthy. Then we stopped at the street parade and watched  cherry pie eating championships. Admittedly finishing 2 cherry pies within one minute is a remarkable effort, maybe we should vote a group member to compete next year.
