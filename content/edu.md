### Course offerings

Our lab is in charge of designing and teaching several courses in the ANU Computer Science cirriculumn.

* **COMP4880/8880 Computational Methods for Network Science**

This is a new course scheduled to commence in Semester 1 (Feb -- June), 2019.

This course covers the essentials of using computational approaches to pose and answer network science research problems.
In particular, it covers a selected set of network algorithms in depth.
This includes random graph models, homophily and friendship paradox, influence and contagion in networks, and network resilience. Furthermore, it also teaches students about the ethics of doing data-driven network science research.â€¨
The course equips the students with in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in working with network data to study social, biological and cognitive processes. Graduates will be equipped with the technical, theoretical and conceptual skills and knowledge to start a budding career in this field.

* **COMP4650/6490 Document Analysis (2015 --)**
