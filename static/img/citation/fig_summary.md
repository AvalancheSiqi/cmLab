The half-wheel on the left is a snapshot of the top venues that cites and cited by this venue (details in Figure 4 below). The survival graph on the right contains the fraction of papers cited at least X years after being published (details in Figure 10 below).

The plots on the rest of this page roughly breaks down into the following types. 

* Figure 1 - Figure 3 contains basic stats of papers, references and citations over its lifetime. 
* Figure 4 and 5 summarizes the incoming and outgoing citations over all years, sorted by the ratio of incoming over outgoing citations (left to right).
* Figure 5 and 6 breaks down the incoming and outgoing citations by year of the conference paper. 
* Figure 7 and 8 breaks down the outgoing references by the year they were cited in this conference. For most conferences we can see a 'google scholar' effect that older papers gets cited more (and from more venues) in recent years, likely due to the ease of finding them. 
* Figure 9-11 explores the question "how many papers are still cited at least after X years", and what fraction of papers are not cited at all.

**Note**: This page visualizes reference and citation patterns of one conference, generated from templates.
